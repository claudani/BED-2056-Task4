#Q5 You are asked to estimate a SARIMA model on the aggregated monthly Order_Quantity in the:

#TODO - aggregated monthly Order_Quantity in the Customer_Segment; Small Business and Product_Category; Office Supplies
#The SARIMA model contains the following parameters:
#p - AR order
#d - difference order
#q - MA order
#P - SAR order
#D - seasonal difference
#Q - SMA order
#S - seasonal period (12 months in these data)
#TODO iterate: => should get 2500 models
#p = [0,4]
#q = [0,4] 
#d = [0,1]
#P = [0,4]
#Q = [0,4]
#D = [0,1]
#S = 12

#1. Estimate these models on the monthly data from 2014 through 2016 
#2. Identify the best SARIMA model on a holdout sample from 2017, based on the smallest RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) 
#3. Produce a plot of the whole time series, and add onto it the 2017 forecast from the best SARIMA model, together with 
#   the actual aggregated monthly Order_Quantity. This output is Figure 2. 
#4. Specify what was the best SARIMA model on the plot
